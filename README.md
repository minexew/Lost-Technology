# Lost Technology

### Original notes from the author

This is the source release, consisting of the makefile, C++ source code, resource bitmaps and reference manual. The package includes source for both variants of the plugin. To build either variant, you need the [VST Audio Plug-Ins SDK](http://ygrabit.steinberg.de/~ygrabit/public_html/index.html). To build the plugin with custom GUI, you also need the VSTGUI source library. The plugin was developed with tools from the [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/) project, version 2.3 of the SDK and version 3.0beta4 of the GUI library; I have not attempted to build it with any other tools or library versions.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** The source code has not been edited to be easy to compile or understand for anyone but me. There is no systematic code documentation and you will almost certainly need to do some tweaking of the makefile and/or C++ code to get a successful build.
